## **ABSTRACT**

This report presents the development of a multi-agent medical assistant system designed as a specialized extension for Cellstrat.ai's existing CellBot.ai platform. The project was undertaken during a summer internship at the Centre of Cognitive Computing and Computational Intelligence (C3I), PES University, from June to July 2025.

The primary objective was to create specialized medical agents that could handle domain-specific medical queries with high accuracy and clinical relevance. The system implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture using IBM Watson AI, LangChain framework, and ChromaDB for vector storage. Four specialized agents were developed: Diabetic Agent, Cancer Agent, Mental Health Agent, and Cardiac Agent, each equipped with domain-specific knowledge bases derived from medical textbooks and guidelines.

The system employs keyword-based query routing to direct user queries to the most appropriate specialized agent. Each agent utilizes conversational memory and retrieval chains to provide contextually relevant responses while maintaining clinical accuracy through carefully tuned hyperparameters and specialized prompt templates.

Key technologies implemented include IBM Watson AI's Mistral-Large model for language generation, IBM Slate-125m-english-rtrvr for embeddings, ChromaDB for vector database operations, and LangChain for orchestrating the multi-agent workflow. The system achieved over 95% accuracy in query routing and demonstrated high clinical relevance in specialized medical discussions.

The project successfully addresses the growing need for specialized AI assistants in healthcare, providing medical students and doctors with domain-specific expertise while maintaining the flexibility to extend to additional medical specialties.

### **4.3 System Components**

**BaseMedicalAgent:** The foundational class providing common functionality across all medical specialties. This component handles model initialization, knowledge base loading, prompt creation, and conversational retrieval chain setup. It ensures consistency in approach while allowing for specialization.

**Specialized Agent Classes:**
- **DiabeticAgent:** Focused on diabetes management, treatment protocols, and blood glucose monitoring
- **CancerAgent:** Specialized in oncology, cancer treatment protocols, and diagnostic procedures  
- **MentalHealthAgent:** Expert in psychiatric conditions, mental health assessment, and therapeutic approaches
- **CardiacAgent:** Cardiovascular specialist handling heart conditions, cardiac protocols, and preventive care

**Knowledge Base Management:** Each agent maintains its own vector database populated with relevant medical literature. The system supports both PDF document ingestion and fallback to curated demo content when specific documents are unavailable.

**Query Processing Pipeline:**
1. **Input Analysis:** User query undergoes initial processing and preprocessing
2. **Domain Classification:** Router determines appropriate specialist based on keyword analysis

## **5. IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **5.1 Agent-Based Architecture**

The implementation of the multi-agent architecture follows object-oriented design principles with clear separation of concerns and modular functionality. The system architecture enables easy extension to additional medical specialties while maintaining consistent behavior across all agents.

**BaseMedicalAgent Implementation:**  
The base class establishes the foundation for all medical agents, implementing shared functionality including model initialization, knowledge base setup, and conversational chains. Key methods include `setup_model()` for Watson AI configuration, `load_knowledge_base()` for document processing, and `create_prompt()` for specialty-specific prompt template creation.

**Specialized Agent Development:**  
Each medical specialty agent inherits from BaseMedicalAgent and implements domain-specific customizations. The DiabeticAgent, for example, includes specialized prompts for blood glucose management and diabetic complications, while the CancerAgent focuses on oncological terminology and treatment protocols.

**Agent Coordination:**  
The MedicalAssistantOrchestrator manages agent interactions through a centralized coordination mechanism. This orchestrator maintains references to all agents, handles global memory management, and coordinates cross-domain conversations when users transition between medical specialties.

**Dynamic Agent Loading:**  
The system implements dynamic agent initialization, allowing for flexible configuration of available medical specialties. This design supports future expansion without requiring architectural changes to the core system.

### **5.2 Knowledge Base Implementation**

**Document Processing Pipeline:**  
The knowledge base implementation utilizes PyPDFLoader for document ingestion, processing medical textbooks and guidelines into machine-readable format. The RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter creates overlapping chunks of 1,000 characters with 200 character overlap to maintain context continuity.

**Vector Database Creation:**  
Each medical specialty maintains its own ChromaDB instance, populated with embedded document chunks using IBM's Slate-125m-english-rtrvr model. This approach ensures domain-specific knowledge isolation while enabling efficient similarity search within each specialty.

**Embedding Strategy:**  
Medical texts undergo preprocessing to optimize embedding quality, including medical terminology normalization and context preservation. The 768-dimensional embedding space captures semantic relationships between medical concepts, enabling accurate retrieval of relevant information.

**Fallback Content System:**  
When specialized medical documents are unavailable, the system falls back to curated demo content containing essential medical information for each specialty. This ensures system functionality even in resource-constrained environments.

### **5.3 RAG Workflow**

**Query Processing:**  
The RAG workflow begins with query analysis and preprocessing, including medical terminology normalization and context extraction from conversation history. The system maintains awareness of previous interactions to provide contextually relevant responses.

**Retrieval Mechanism:**  
Vector similarity search identifies the top-5 most relevant knowledge chunks from the appropriate domain-specific database. The retrieval process considers both semantic similarity and contextual relevance to current conversation topics.

**Augmentation Process:**  
Retrieved medical knowledge is combined with specialized prompt templates and conversation history to create comprehensive context for the language model. This augmentation ensures responses are grounded in medical literature while maintaining conversational flow.

**Generation and Validation:**  
The IBM Watson AI model generates responses using the augmented context, with hyperparameters tuned for medical accuracy. The system includes validation mechanisms to ensure response quality and appropriate medical terminology usage.

### **5.4 Hyperparameter Tuning**

**Language Model Configuration:**  
Extensive hyperparameter tuning focused on optimizing clinical accuracy and reliability. The temperature setting of 0.1 encourages factual, deterministic output while minimizing hallucination risks. The maximum token limit of 512 ensures comprehensive responses without excessive verbosity.

**Retrieval Optimization:**  
The top-k retrieval parameter was set to 5 based on empirical testing, balancing information completeness with response coherence. Chunk size and overlap parameters were optimized for medical content, ensuring important clinical information spans chunk boundaries appropriately.

**Memory Management:**  
Conversation buffer parameters were tuned to maintain sufficient context (10 messages for agent-specific memory, 20 for global memory) while avoiding information overload that could impact response quality.

**Performance Optimization:**  
Repetition penalty (1.1) and nucleus sampling (top-p: 0.9) parameters were adjusted to improve response diversity while maintaining clinical accuracy. These parameters underwent iterative refinement based on evaluation feedback and demonstration results.
